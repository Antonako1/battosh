About:
    CD Changes Directory to the given path
    CHDIR and CD are the same, but CHDIR does not
    need to surround the path with quotes if it has spaces in it

    CD on its own displays the current path same as "pwd" in linux.
    It is also stored in a variable called %CD%

    The flag /D is used to change the drive along with the directory.
    Since linux has all of the drives under /mnt/, this flag is not needed
    and thus will not be included. 

    The program includes a few flags used to automatically change paths included
    in the scripts, some of these flags are --wsl and --linux.
    --wsl tries to change the paths to work with WSL
    --linux tries to change the paths to the corresponding ones on linux
    See example section to see how these work
