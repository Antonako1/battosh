About:
    Comment (Remark) is used to record comments
    There are three ways of doing comments:
    "@REM"          => The sole reason this is included is because VSCode's comment shortcut creates "@REM"
    "REM"
    "::"
    All of these will be turned into "#"

    The program has a flag for preserving the comments from batch to shell:
    -sc, --save-comments. This is not on by default!

Command: REM
Flags:
1. /?           => Display help message
