About:
    RMDIR or RD deletes a directory

    When the program receives flags -qm or --set-quietmode
    and a command contains a /Q (Quiet) flag, it will
    redirect the output to /dev/null. See examples

Command: RMDIR or RD
Flags:

Flag                => About
1. /?               => Displays help message
2. /Q               => Quiet mode. If paired with /S will not ask if to remove a directory
2. /S               => Removes all subdirectories and files
