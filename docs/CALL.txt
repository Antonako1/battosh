About:
    Call does what it says, call a given batch file

    It does not function the same way in linux as in windows
    In windows, call is used to call a batch file and return 
    to the file it was called from.
    In linux, just providing the path to the shell script is 
    enough and it will return running the script.
    However passing the same environmental variables can be done
    by using a "." or "source".
    And again, it comes to me, whether to use "source" or not...
    
    The program turns "CALL" to "source".
    Note: If flag -bs or --bat-shell is given, all occurences of ".bat" will be turned to ".sh"
